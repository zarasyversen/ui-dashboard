##  Web App Product UI Design - Designed by Mason Yarnell 

I built a replica of Mason Yarnell's design for a web app product (found on Dribbble). 

This is a display of my CSS skills and I am very happy with the result. I started with desktop layout only but added some media queries to make it work for smaller devices as well. The button/links are #, besides the menu and search button (on mobile).
